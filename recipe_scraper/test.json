About 1-2 minutes or watch for bubbles on the sauce.\nAdd sugar and fish sauce, stir, and simmer for 1 minute.\nAdd the chicken, water, and cook for 4-5 more minutes until the chicken is tender. If using tofu, shrimp, or vegetables, cook for only 2-3 minutes.\nAdd pineapple, tomatoes, and the vegetables, cover, and cook until slightly soft, 2-3 minutes.\nAdd the rest of the coconut milk and adjust the flavors with more fish sauce, salt, sugar, and extra curry paste to find your perfect balance. Add a squeeze of lime if you like. Keep in mind, that serving it over rice will mellow the flavor considerably.\nTurn off the heat, add the Thai basil, and stir in one last time. Let cool slightly and serve over jasmine rice and top with more fresh basil and enjoy!"

  "title": "Grilled Bok Choy with Ponzu Sauce",
  "instructions": "Make the ponzu dressing by whisking all the ingredients together.\nPrepare the Bok Choy by pulling off the outer pieces. There is often a core in tact that you can cut in half or in quarters depending the size. Rinse all pieces and pat dry the stems. It is good to keep a little moisture on the leaves to keep them from charring too much.\nPreheat Grill to high and let it fully heat for 10-15 minutes.\nBrush Bok Choy with oil. We give a light sprinkle of salt here but that is optional as the Ponzu sauce does contain soy sauce.\nGrill for 3-4 minutes on each side. The leaves will get a little toasty, you can just discard if they become too charred. (You can also layer the leaf on top of the Bok Choy next to it as you lay it on the grill, so that the leaf is not directly on the grates.)\nServe immediately with a drizzle of Ponzu sauce."
